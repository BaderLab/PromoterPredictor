======================= UPDATING SQLite TABLES =================================

The promoter predictor takes advantage of SQLite3 in order to organize genetic
data in relational database tables. Although all relevant tables of information
are provided, it is understood that this data may become outdated in the future.
To circumvent this potential issue, we provide scripts that allow users to
input updated data files for the 5 feature selected features used by the
learner and generate updated SQLite tables that will be used when generating
feature vectors. All data that is currently being used can be found within the
"data" folder. When updating any of the feature values, please ensure the file
name of the new input file is the same as the one it is replacing. To ensure
your input file has the correct format, match it to that of the given file,
being cautious of headers, spacing etc.

The following scripts will update the necessary SQLite tables:
1) create_gene_info_SQLiteTable.py
2) create_methProbes_SQLiteTable.py
3) create_CpG_SQLiteTable.py
4) create_chipPeaks_SQLiteTable.py

In order to update the data feature you are interested follow these steps:
  1) Change out all required files with updated files *using the same file name*
  in the "data" folder
  2) Run the script in terminal

  Example: Updating the gene information tables:
    1) Replace "refseq_genes.txt" and/or "biomart_genes.txt" in "data" folder
    with new versions with the same file names
    2) Run in terminal:
        python create_gene_info_SQLiteTable.py

**NOTE:**
All of these scripts assume that you are working out of the "promoter_predictor"
root directory where all of the scripts are contained to run the promoter region
predictor.

================Detailed instructions for running each script:==================
1) create_gene_info_SQLiteTable.py
This script is used to update the reference genome utilized by the learner. The
default included genome is Hg19 and all coordinates for feature values are the
same. This script requires two input files:
  - "refseq_genes.txt"
      Contains the coordinates for all genes in the human genome based on the
      refseq standard.
  - "biomart_genes.txt"
      Contains the coordinates for all genes in the human genome based on the
      biomart standard.

2) create_methProbes_SQLiteTable.py
This script will update the genomic location of methylation probes mapping to
the human genome. The original probe coordinates are gathered from the
HumanMethylation450k array. This script requires one file:
  - "methylation_probes.txt"
      Contains genomic coordinates for methylation probes mapping to the human
      genome based on the HumanMethylation450k array.

3) create_CpG_SQLiteTable.py
This script will update the genomic location of CpG islands across the human
genome. The original table contains information from UCSC's CpG island tracks as
described in detail in the original manuscript. This script requires one input
file:
  - "cpg_island.txt"
      Contains genomic coordinates of CpG islands across the human genome based
      on the data accumulated by UCSC in their CpG island track

4) create_chipPeaks_SQLiteTable.py
This script will update the genomic location of ChIP-Seq peaks across the human
genome for the 3 cell-line/histone mark combinations that were feature selected.
These files can be found via the Epigenetics roadmap project's website here:
http://egg2.wustl.edu/roadmap/data/byFileType/peaks/consolidated/narrowPeak/
This script requires 3 input files:
  -"E029-H3K36me3.narrowPeak"
  -"E037-H3K36me3.narrowPeak"
  -"E118-H3K36me3.narrowPeak"
    All Of these files contain the genomic coordiantes of ChIP-seq peaks across
    the human genome and can be found via the Epigenetics roadmap projects
    website linked above.
